			<h2>Working With Devices</h2>

			<p>Squinter keeps track of your development devices. It lists these in the ‘Device Groups’ menu’s ‘Project’s
			Device Groups’ submenu, alongside the Device Group each device is assigned to. Unassigned devices are listed
			in their own section. Specific devices can also be selected from the ‘Current Device’ popup menu in Squinter’s
			main window.</p>

            <p><img src="gfx/devices.png" width="600" /></p>

			<p>In each of these lists, devices’ status &mdash; online or offline, or logging &mdash; is listed by their names.</p>

			<p>The ‘Device’ menu presents actions you can perform on the currently selected device, including getting information
			about it, renaming it, removing it from your account and removing its association with a Device Group (unassign it).</p>

			<p>You can also force the device to restart. If you want to force all the devices assigned to a given Device Group to
			restart, not just the selected one, there’s an option for that in the ‘Device Groups’ menu.</p>

			<p>To update the information Squinter holds about all of of your development devices, select the ‘Update Devices’ Status’
			command in the ‘Devices’ menu. This can be selected at any time, and there is an option in Squinter’s Preferences to have
			this information retrieved automatically whenever the app starts up.</p>

			<p><img src="gfx/dlist.png" width="402" /></p>

			<p>The ‘Devices’ menu also maintains a submenu of unassigned devices &mdash; those which have not yet been assigned to a
			Device Group or have been removed from one. Selecting a device from this list will affect the ‘Devices’ menu but not the
			currently selected Device Group.</p>
